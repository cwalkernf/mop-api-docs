### Use the token with an API operation

Include the expiring bearer token in your request to the NetFoundry API. You could source the shell script above to make `NETFOUNDRY_API_TOKEN` available.

**HTTPie**

```bash
❯ http GET https://gateway.production.netfoundry.io/rest/v1/networks \
  "Authorization: Bearer ${NETFOUNDRY_API_TOKEN}"
```

**cURL**

```bash
❯ curl https://gateway.production.netfoundry.io/rest/v1/networks \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer ${NETFOUNDRY_API_TOKEN}"
```
