## The Web Console

the [NetFoundry Web Console](https://nfconsole.io/) is an implementation of the API and so may help to express the model of the API while you're learning [how to build an AppWAN](/v1/guides/hello-appwan/). For example, you might inspect the HTTP requests sent from your browser if you're unsure how to automate a particular action and need a hint for searching [the API reference](/v1/reference/).

## Representations

This RESTful API transacts meaningful HTTP verbs and request paths and parameters. Most types of requests and responses also have an HTTP document body which is always a JSON representation. Requests that include a JSON body must also include a header `Content-Type: application/json`, and responses with a JSON body will have this header too.

You'll find the [API definition and reference](/reference/) here. You can also browse the available API endpoints with contextual descriptions and example requests and responses in [the playground](/v1/playground/) which is running Swagger UI.

### Hypermedia Links

The API responds with `_links` map for navigation. With this you can avoid the brittleness of hard-coding URL paths in your implementation.

For example, a request like `GET /rest/v1/organizations` might return a list of one in `_embedded.organizations`. This is a great starting place because your implementation could then navigate to the "networks" link which is list of all networks in this organization a.k.a. "network group".

```json
{
    "_embedded" : {
        "organizations" : [ {
            "createdAt": "2020-05-23T09:20:26.000+0000",
            "updatedAt": "2020-05-23T09:20:26.000+0000",
            "name": "exampleOrganization11",
            "organizationShortName": "EXORG11",
            "mfaRequired": false,
            "zitiEnabled": true,
            "awsAutoScalingGatewayEnabled": false,
            "defaultAzureVirtualWanId": null,
            "billingAccountId": "fda91466-56bc-458f-bf8d-c8f04cd39898",
            "ownerIdentityId": null,
            "id": "cb621953-1f50-4fd9-907a-bdc0dbebde9c",
            "_links": {
                "self": {
                "href": "https://gateway.production.netfoundry.io/rest/v1/organizations/cb621953-1f50-4fd9-920a-bdc0dbebde9c"
                },
                "networks": {
                "href": "https://gateway.production.netfoundry.io/rest/v1/networks"
                },
                "azureSubscription": {
                "href": "https://gateway.production.netfoundry.io/rest/v1/azureSubscriptions?organizationId=cb621953-1f50-4fd9-920a-bdc0dbebde9c"
                }
            }
        } ]
    }
}
```

Now following the "networks" link would return all networks. If you extract the `.page` object from the response you will see something like this which indicates there are 211 total networks on 22 pages of 10 each, and you've just consumed page 1.

```json
{
  "size": 10,
  "totalElements": 211,
  "totalPages": 22,
  "number": 1
}
```

To advance you'd send a request for page 2 using the parameters that are described in [the API definition](/reference/). A request like `GET /rest/v1/networks?page=0&size=10&sort=name,asc` will return up to ten networks as an array. Here's an example response for just one network.

```json
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "networks" : [ {
        "createdAt": "2019-12-14T07:13:47.000+0000",

            }
        }
    } ]
  }
}
```

From here we can see a clear path to inspect the endpoints, services, and AppWANs for this particular network. Good luck and let us know what else you'd like to see in this introduction: [contact](/help/) or send a pull request with the EDIT link below!
