## The Web Console

the [NetFoundry Web Console](https://nfconsole.io/) is an implementation of the API and so may help to express the model of the API while you're learning [how to build an AppWAN](/v2/guides/hello-world/). For example, you might inspect the HTTP requests sent from your browser if you're unsure how to automate a particular action and need a hint for searching [the API reference](/v2/reference/).

## Representations

This RESTful API transacts meaningful HTTP verbs and request paths and parameters. Most types of requests and responses also have an HTTP document body which is always a JSON representation. Requests that include a JSON body must also include a header `Content-Type: application/json`, and responses with a JSON body will have this header too.

You'll find the [API definition and reference](/v2/reference/) here.
