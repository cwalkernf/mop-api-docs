NetFoundry is built with Ziti. Ziti is open-source software for building programmable, zero-trust networks. You can use Ziti SDK identities with your NetFoundry network. For example, you can embed Ziti in your custom app with the SDK so it can participate in a NetFoundry network directly without any external software or gateways. Your app will communicate with the Ziti fabric hosted by NetFoundry through the built-in Ziti libraries. If your app is a service this means it can be reached anywhere, from anywhere, by any endpoint you allow without a static public IP address. Your Zitified service is invisible except to your allowed Endpoints.

Visit the [Ziti web site](https://ziti.dev) to learn more about the Open Ziti project and SDKs.

See [Hello, World!](/v2/guides/hello-world/) for a step-by-step example using Ziti with NetFoundry.
