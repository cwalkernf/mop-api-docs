## Audience

This documentation is aimed at enabling devops practitioners to automate things they can already do with the [NetFoundry Web Console](https://nfconsole.io/) and to create integrations with the NetFoundry platform. If you are looking for a general introduction to NetFoundry then the [Support Hub](https://support.netfoundry.io/hc/en-us) or the [main web site](https://netfoundry.io) are places you could begin.

## Your Code, NetFoundry's API

The API allows you to manage your AppWANs with your own code. You could program your AppWAN to

* disallow a lost or non-compliant device from connecting,
* allow a new device to connect to a service based on some event or condition,
* create a path to a new network service for an existing group of devices, or
* trigger an alert based on an unexpected metric that NetFoundry reports.
